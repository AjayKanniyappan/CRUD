## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the [CRUD](https://github.com/AjayKanniyappan/CRUD) and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [Deploy](#-deploy-your-own) for notes on how to lunch your PWA app in live.

### 📚 Before You Begin

Before you begin i recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble a **CRUD**:

- **React.js** - React's [Official Website](https://reactjs.org/) is a great starting point. You can also use [W3Schools Popular Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/DEFAULT.ASP), and [Egghead Videos](https://egghead.io/).

- **TypeScript** - Go through [TypeScript Official Website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/), which should help you understand TypeScript better.

- **Node.js** - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.

### 🖥️ Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

- **Git** - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
- **Node.js** - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.

NOTE: This project requires NodeJS (version 14 or later) and NPM.
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) are really easy to install.

## 🛫 Quick Start

There are several ways you can get the CRUD:

### 🌀 Cloning The GitHub Repository

The recommended way to get CRUD is to use git to directly clone the repository:

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/AjayKanniyappan/CRUD.git <your-project-name>

# Enter the project directory
cd <your-project-name>
```

This will clone the latest version of the CRUD repository to a **CRUD** folder.

### 🗃️ Downloading The Repository Zip File

Another way to use the CRUD is to download a zip copy from the [main branch on GitHub](https://github.com/AjayKanniyappan/CRUD/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). You can also do this using the `wget` command:

```sh
wget https://github.com/AjayKanniyappan/CRUD/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -O CRUD.zip; unzip CRUD.zip; rm CRUD.zip
```

Don't forget to rename CRUD-main after your project name.

### 🧰 Quick Install

Once you've downloaded the Template and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your CRUD Web App using React.js.

The Template comes pre-bundled with a `package.json` file that contain the list of modules you need to start your application.

To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:

```bash
# Install dependency
npm install
```

Or if you prefer using Yarn:

```bash
# Install dependency
yarn install
```

This command does a few things:

- First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
- If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.

## 👨‍💻 Starting Development

Use your favorite JavaScript Package Managers **npm** or **yarn** or **pnpm**

### 🏃 Running Your Application

**Run your application using npm:**

```sh
npm run dev
```

Or if you prefer using Yarn:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Your **React.js** application should run on port 5050 with the development environment configuration, so in your browser just go to http://localhost:5050

That's it! Your application should be running. To proceed with your development, check the other sections in this documentation. If you encounter any problems, Feel free to check [issues page](https://github.com/AjayKanniyappan/CRUD/issues).

### 🛬 Change Port Number

If the localhost 5050 port number already in use! or if you like to change your **React.js application number.**

Go to 👉 package.json and change the port number 5050 to **your-port-number**

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114384910/219876224-ffb8dd05-dd26-49e5-9004-f8581d1a889a.png" alt="port" /></p>

### 🆚 Vscode Debugging

This guide goes over how to start **VSCode debugging** your **React.js** Project.

you can easily debug this [CRUD](https://github.com/AjayKanniyappan/CRUD).

To bring up the Run and Debug view, select the Run and Debug icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+D`.

Click the button or press `F5` to start debugging

### 🧹 Clean Cache

If you want clean the cache files and node_modules cache run this below command 👇:

```sh
npm run clean
```

NOTE: It will remove your **node_module** folder, **build** files and **env** files.

### 💈 Style your Code

The [CRUD](https://github.com/AjayKanniyappan/CRUD) has [Eslint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [Airbnb](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/) Configurations, this will help you to Style your code and syntax check and more.

[Eslint](https://eslint.org/) will check syntax, find problems, and enforce code style of your code.

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) will format your code style.

All you have to do is run this below command 👇:

```sh
npm run lint
```

NOTE: This command show you the warnings and errors in your code.

### 🛰️ Git Commits

Automate your [Git](https://git-scm.com/) commits using Husky, and don't commit or push the bad code in git.

Husky improves your commits and more, You can use it to lint your commit messages, run tests, lint code, etc... when you commit or push. Husky supports [all Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks).

Run below command 👇 to prepare Husky:

```sh
npm run prepare
```

See docs and more about [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=features).

That's it! Your application should be running. To proceed with your development, check the other sections in this documentation. If you encounter any problems, Feel free to check [issues page](https://github.com/AjayKanniyappan/nextjs-pwa-template/issues).

## 🚢 Deploy your own

Congratulations, you are ready to deploy your [CRUD](https://github.com/AjayKanniyappan/CRUD) to production. This document will teach how to deploy vercel or self-hosted.

### 🔼 Vercel

The easiest way to deploy React.js to production is to use the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=learn_basics_deploying-nextjs-app_deploy) platform developed by the creators of React.js.

NOTE: If you want to read more about [vercel](https://vercel.com/home?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=learn_basics_deploying-nextjs-app_deploy), kindly read this 🙏 [Documentation](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/deploying-nextjs-app/deploy).

### 👻 Self-Hosting

[CRUD](https://github.com/AjayKanniyappan/CRUD) can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Node.js.

If you’ve followed the instructions so far, your package.json should have the following build and start scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "clean": "git clean -dfX",
    "dev": "vite --port 5050",
    "lint": "eslint --fix --max-warnings 0 .",
    "prepare": "husky install",
    "start": "npm run build && vite preview --port 5050"
  }
```

```sh
npm run build
```

In your own hosting provider, run the build script once, which builds the production application in the `.dist` folder.

After building, the start script starts a Node.js server that supports hybrid pages, serving both statically generated and server-side rendered pages, and API Routes.

```sh
npm run start
```

NOTE: If you want to read more about deployment, kindly read this 🙏 [Documentation](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/deployment.md).
